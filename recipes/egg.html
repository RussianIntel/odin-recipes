        <p><h3>Who doesn't like devilled eggs?</h3></p>
        <p>This one is really simple</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>9 eggs</li>
                    <li>4.5 tbsp mayo</li>
                    <li>1.5 tsp Dijon Mustard</li>
                    <li>1.5 tsp Apple Cider vinegar</li>
                    <li>salt, pepper and paprika to taste</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and cover with enough water that there's 1 1/2 inches of water above the eggs. Heat on high until water begins to boil, then cover, turn the heat to low, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and leave covered for 14 minutes, then rinse under cold water continuously for 1 minute. </li>
                    <li>Crack egg shells and carefully peel under cool running water. Gently dry with paper towels. Slice the eggs in half lengthwise, removing yolks to a medium bowl, and placing the whites on a serving platter. Mash the yolks into a fine crumble using a fork. Add mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper, and mix well. </li>
                    <li>Evenly disperse heaping teaspoons of the yolk mixture into the egg whites. Sprinkle with paprika and serve. </li>
                    <li><h2>PROFIT!</h2></li>
